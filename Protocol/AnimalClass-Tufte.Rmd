The COMADRE Animal Matrix Database includes animals of numerous taxonomic classes. This document outlines some basic information about these animal species.

## Aves (Vögel)

Birds are mostly based on **terrestrial** ecoregions from costal to rain forests, although some of them may spend significant portions of their lifespans at sea. Reproduction type is **sexual**.

\end{marginfigure}

## Bivalvia (Muscheln)

These organisms have a two-piece shell and that’s why they’re called bivalvia. They live in **freshwater** and **marine** ecoregions burried in the sediment, fixed on rocks or on the ground. **Sexual** reproduction is common in them. In their life-cycles, free-living **larvae** are the stages after hatching. The first larval stage is called trochophora larvae, which then develops into a veliger larvae. The latter one settles on the ground and grows to juveniles. A few species are **hermaphrodites** (male and female organs in same individual).

## Branchiopoda (Kiemenfußkrebse)

This group is constituted by crustaceans, which have gills, like shrimp, Daphnia (Wasserfloh), *{Artemia salina* (Urzeitkrebs). Ecoregions are mostly **freshwater**, sometimes **marine** (*Daphnia*). Their reproduction is sexual but there are some exceptions; for instance, individuals of *Daphnia* can reproduce by **parthenogenesis**, whereby females reproduce asexually from unfertilized yet viable eggs.

## Cephalaspidomorphi

This class contains jawless (kieferlose) fishes, most of them are now in the fossil record. Some examples include lampreys. They live in **freshwater** and **marine** (mostly costal, seldom open sea) ecosystems. In their life cycles,ß **larvae** live buried in the sediment for several years.

## Clitellata (Gürtelwürmer)

These class includes worms such as earthworms (Regenwürmer), leeches (Egel) and e.g. *Tubifex* (used for fish food). Their ecoregions are mostly **terrestrial** but also **freshwater** and **marine**. Reproduction is **sexual** and they are **hermaphrodites** (male and female organs in same individual).

## Demospongiae (Hornkieselschwämme)

This class represents 81 % of sponges. Individuals of the largest species can attain over 1 m in length. They are all **marine**, except one species, which occurs in fresh water. These sponges have both **sexual** and **asexual** reproduction. Life cycles are complicated regarding to complex asexual reproduction with budding (Knospung) and/or gemmules (Dauerstadium=dormancy).

## Diplopoda (Doppelfüßer)

This class includes millepedes (Tausendfüßer). These animals live in terrestrial, mostly tropical ecoregions. Reproduction types are **sexual** and **asexual**. A special feature of their life cycles is **parthenogenesis** (females asexually produce not fertilized but viable eggs).

## Echinoidea (Seeigel)

Sea urchins live in marine ecoregions. They reproduce **sexually** and have a **larval stage** called pluteus.

## Elasmobranchii (Plattenkiemer)

This class includes all cartiloginous fish such as sharks as well as rays (Rochen). These fishes only live in **marine** ecoregions and reproduce **sexually** for the most part, although some sharks can reproduce by **parthenogenesis** too.

## Gastropoda (Schnecken)

This class includes all snails, molluscs with or without a shell. They live in different environments in **terrestrial**, **marine** and **freshwater** ecoregions. Some species are **hermaphrodites** (male and female organs in same individual). Their life cycles include a **larval stage**, which in water is known as veliger or trochophore.

## Gymnoleamata 

This group is a sectin of bryozoa (Moostierchen), which are small multicellular organisms living in water. They are found mostly in **marine** and also **freshwater** ecosystems. Reproduction includes **sexual** and **asexual** parts. The single animals build big colonies via **asexual budding** (Knospung).

## Homo sapiens

Homo sapiens are not a class (they are in Class Mammalia) but they are recorded in our Excel spreadsheet within their own Worksheet, although when all the data are released they are lumped with the rest of mammals. Their ecoregions are **terrestrial** and reproduction is **sexual**.

## Insecta (Insekten)

Insects are animals with three pairs of legs and compound-eyes. They live in **terrestrial** but also in **freshwater** and **marine** ecoregions. Reproduction is **sexual** and sometimes **asexual**. The life cycle includes the stages **larva** and **pupa** and can be partly in water also for terrestrial organisms. Sometimes there is **parthenogenesis** (females asexually produce not fertilized but viable eggs).
